# Walmart Customer Churn Prediction

A Streamlit-based web application that predicts customer churn risk using Walmartâ€™s customer purchase behavior dataset. The project leverages machine learning models (Random Forest & Logistic Regression) and provides interactive dashboards for churn analysis.

# Features

ðŸ“‚ Load dataset from Kaggle (via kagglehub) or upload your own CSV file

ðŸ§¹ Automatic data preprocessing:
- Date handling
- Recency calculation
- Churn labels (Churn_Repeat, Churn_Recency)

ðŸ¤– Train multiple ML models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression) and compare accuracies

ðŸ“Š Interactive dashboards with:
- Confusion matrices
- Risk distribution histograms
- Customer risk ranking tables

ðŸ“¥ Export top 100 at-risk customers as CSV files

ðŸ“Š Types of Churn Analysis
- Repeat Customer Churn â€“ Customers marked as   churned if not repeat buyers
- Recency Churn â€“ Customers inactive for more than 90 days

Combined Risk Analysis â€“ Weighted churn risk from both approaches
